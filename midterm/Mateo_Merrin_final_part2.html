    What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?<br>
    I had no experience in any of these languages.<br>
Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?<br>
    I built most of the template but the original base was from one of our assignments.<br>
What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)<br>
    Making it look good. I really struggled with CSS and it became a complicated mess that doesn't even look good.<br>
How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? <br>
    I have a lot more appreciation for people who have to figure out how to make the design of websites.<br>
What would you recommend to future students taking this class?<br>
    Yes, I learned so much and I feel like I can learn even more. Plus it was a lot of fun.<br>
