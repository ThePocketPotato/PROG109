			This class is focused on the C# programming language. When I first enrolled in the class I had no idea how to code in C# at all. It was a completly new experience for me.
			Over several months I learned how the basic functions and mechanics worked as well as slightly more complicated topics. White I still have much to learn I am able to freely use functions, arrays, classes, and much more to solve problems.
			This class pushed me from knowing nothing to being able to code in C# and I am always ready to learn more.</div>
