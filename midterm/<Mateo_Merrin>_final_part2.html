    What was your previous knowledge of HTML/CSS/Javascript?
    I had no experience in any of these languages.
Did you use a template or did you build your portfolio from scratch?
    I built most of the template but the original base was from one of our assignments.
What was your most challenging part of your portfolio (ie, the template, artifacts, CSS, etc.)
    Making it look good. I really struggled with CSS and it became a complicated mess that doesn't even look good.
How taking this class changed your view on Web Development? 
    I have a lot more appreciation for people who have to figure out how to make the design of websites.
What would you recommend to future students taking this class?
    Yes, I learned so much and I feel like I can learn even more. Plus it was a lot of fun.
