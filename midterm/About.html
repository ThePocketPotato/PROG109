		My name is Mateo Merrin and I am planning on becoming a software engineer. I grew up in Washington State with my two sisters, my mother, and my father. 
			I have three cats who I have lived with for over 16 years and I love spending time with them. My past times are reading, video games, board games, and bouldering.
			I plan on going to Gonzaga University in order to study computer science to get a four year degree. I am not yet sure of the exact path I will be taking.
			My main points of intrests are data science and cyber security. I also don't know where I want to go after I graduate yet.
